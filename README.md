# ICL_RPIPW_ST_V1 case for Raspberry Pi Pico W with straight pin headers
Plastic case ICL_RPIPW_ST_V1 by ICL with passive ventilation and Dupont cable management system for the popular Raspberry Pi Pico W devboard released in 2022 with straight pin headers and micro-USB connector.
## Description
### What is it?
This is a 3D-printed plastic case specifically designed for Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontrollers with straight pin headers. It is one of the products in the IoT Case Lab (aka ICL) line of cases.

The design of the case model was conceived and developed to make the controller convenient to use, minimizing the time spent on assembly and connecting the rest of the project components.

If your Raspberry Pi Pico W has side-mounted pin headers, we recommend considering another ICL-made case (ICL_RPIPW_SI_V1), which is designed specifically for this pin configuration.

### Who is it for? 
This case is suitable for use in DIY projects that use the popular Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller (the green board with the micro USB connector, from 2022).

Radio amateurs and DIY enthusiasts who need to conveniently connect project components to the RPi Pico W controller will find this case simple and easy to install and use, especially for connecting companion components with cable harnesses (Dupont-style connectors).

We hope to see both beginners and professionals in the ICL case line's user base, including those involved in designing and building smart devices and home automation. The case should also appeal to those who spend a lot of time in a lab: students and teachers, testers, programmers, and those creating educational materials or running a technical blog.

### Why did you make it?
In the DIY field, there is a wide variety of microcontroller boards based on popular hardware platforms like Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi Pico.

All of these controllers are sold as "Dev Boards," which come with pre-soldered straight pin headers. This format is most often used with Dupont connectors to connect components to the controller.

Pin headers on the main controller board are a very convenient way to quickly connect and disconnect components in a project, especially for users who don't want to solder. However, there is a significant drawback: Dupont connectors often don't stay in place well. This can lead to a poor connection at best, and frequent disconnections between components at worst. This is very frustrating, especially when a project has many connections or is built in a limited space.

When developing this product, ICL aimed to solve several problems at once:
- Allow the use of Dupont connectors while securely fastening them to the pin headers.
- Protect the controller board with a plastic case to prevent accidental short circuits from various metal surfaces.
- Securely hold the controller in place.
- Create a well-designed case for the standard controller module.
- Provide the ability to connect (combine) cases of various sizes, layouts, and purposes for project components.

### What makes it special?
- Designed specifically for the Raspberry Pi Pico W controller.
- The panel securely fastens the Dupont connectors in place.
- All pin headers on the controller board are accessible for connections.
- The controller is secured inside the case using the four standard mounting holes on the RPi Pico W board.
- The BOOTSEL button is accessible through a hole in the case.
- The case has its own external mounting tabs.
- Although not originally intended, the internal space of the case also allows for the installation of pin headers for the DEBUG port (SWDIO, GND, SWCLK).
- Features special ICL Square Finger Joints - universal inter-case connectors - that are equipped on all IoT Case Lab products.
- Ventilation holes are located on three sides: two side faces and the top of the case, to provide passive cooling.

### What's in the box, assembly, and installation
#### Product includes
- Case - 1 pc;
- Button cap - 1 pc;
- Case panel - 1 pc;

Note: Screws, bolts, and nuts are not included with the product. The Raspberry Pi Pico W controller board is not included.

#### Product properies
- Case weight (plastic parts only): 00.00 g.
- Material: PLA plastic.
- Color: The color matches the photo. The shade may vary slightly from batch to batch and is not dependent on the ICL.

#### Required skills, parts, and tools

- Screws with nuts for securing the bottom cover and mounting the case to a surface — 4 pcs.
#### Assembly steps
1. Flip the case upside down (the side with the ventilation and button hole).
2. Using tweezers, place the button cap in its designated spot from the inside.
3. Insert the controller board, chip-side down (pin headers up), into its place. The micro USB connector should go into its opening first, and then the rest of the board should rest on the internal mounting posts.
4. Secure the controller board with four screws inside the case, ensuring the button cap functions correctly in its hole.
5. Install the necessary cable connectors onto the controller's pin headers so that they lie along both long sides of the case.
6. Close the bottom opening of the case with the corresponding panel.
7. Flip the entire assembly into a normal position and, if needed, attach the case to a surface using the mounting tabs. Alternatively, use the mounting tabs to secure the bottom panel you've just installed.
